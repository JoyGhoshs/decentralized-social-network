# Decentralized Social Network

As the majority of the social network is hosting their services on their owen server,
the privacy as well as the content is usually controlled by the service provider.
Our decentralized social network allows the user to post without data stored on a central data server but distributed to all user nodes.
<br />

## Making a post

Currently, there is no requirements on the account registration. Anyone could make a post providing the username and the post content.
After the post is made, the server will mine the block of that post and then display the content of post with time descending order<br />
