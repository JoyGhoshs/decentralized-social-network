# Decentralized Social Network

As the majority of the social network is hosting their services on their owen server,
the privacy as well as the content is usually controlled by the service provider.
Our decentralized social network allows the user to post without data stored on a central data server but distributed to all user nodes.

## How to run?

* Server:<br/>
    In order to make the server up and accessible by users outside the LAN, the ngrok is required.<br/>
    Start the server by running `python3 run.py` and remember to install all python packages needed to run the server.<br/>
    Now, the server should be up successfully with statistics and network traffic information displayed.<br/>

* Client:<br/>
    In the IDE or in the terminal, simply run the `client.py` with a port that does not collide with other services. In PyCharm, the port is 5000 by default.<br/>
    Once the client is up, the URL to the application will be provided in the terminal. Click the link to access the web application.<br/>
    Now you have the decentralized social network! Have Fun!<br/>

# User Manual

* ## Making a post

    Currently, there is no requirements on the account registration. Anyone could make a post providing the username and the post content.<br/>
    After the post is made, the server will mine the block of that post and then display the content of post with time descending order.<br/>
